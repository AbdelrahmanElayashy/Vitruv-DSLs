[Vitruvius](https://vitruv.tools) is a framework for view-based software development. It assumes different models to be used for describing a software system,
which are automatically kept consistent by the framework and its applications. For general information on Vitruvius, see our [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/vitruv-tools) and our [Wiki](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/.github/wiki).

This DSLs project provides several languages to specify consistency preservation rules for keeping models consistent with the Vitruvius framework.

## Installation
Vitruvius can be installed in Eclipse via the [nightly update site](https://vitruv.tools/updatesite/nightly). A wiki page provides [detailed instructions for using or extending Vitruvius](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Project Development

Vitruvius, as well as the DSLs, is realized as Eclipse plug-ins and depends on the following Eclipse tools:
- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) _as the modelling environment_
- Xtext _for language development_
- Xtend _for code_
